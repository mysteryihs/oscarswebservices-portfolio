### Do you work with Squarespace, Wix and etc?
What allows an average person to build a website using a website builder restricts what we're able to do. So what you're able to do is pretty much what we're able to do. If you find that sites like Squarespace or Wix are not fulfilling your needs then contact us now and we can help.

### Why should I bother with a website?
A common complaint from business owners is that they pay for a website and it does nothing to help their business.  A website is like a billboard, it requires traffic in order to become effective. Because of that, websites are at their best when accompanied with social media and online business listings. If you believe that your business wont benefit from such an online presence, then you may not need a website afterall.

### Do you do SEO, digital marketing or advertising?
Outside of website SEO, we do not do SEO, digital marketing or advertising. We specialize in designing and developing websites, but we will gladly share any knowledge we have and will try to point you in the right direction.

### So what *can* you do?
[See our services here.](/services)


### Why should I choose you over somebody else?
Many web agencies choose to build their websites through builders like Squarespace and Wix or outsource their work often overseas. If you are satisfied with their results and price point then there is no reason to choose us over them. However, if you find that what you got is disappointing or their services are lacking then feel free to contact us. All our development work is done in-house and our customer service is second to none.
