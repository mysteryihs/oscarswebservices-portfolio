### Our story
Our story began when working and interviewing for agencies and companies doing web development and realizing one important thing. **Most businesses don't know what they're doing when it comes to websites.** Our business sets out to help solve this problem.

We're a business made up of self-taught web developers and web designers trying to help others make sense of the growing technology, including ourselves.

We don't claim to know everything when it comes to web development as it is a big field, but if we're working together then we'll do our best to help you achieve your end result.
